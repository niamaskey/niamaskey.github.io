Moses Creek -> Chalice Lake -> Cathedral Mountain - Junction Lake -> Meston Lake -> Mount Rogoona


We set off on saturday morning at around 10am along the Moses Creek track, with the goal of spending the night atop Cathedral Mountain. The track starts at the end of the Mersey Forest Road, with the walkers registration about 1km down the track. The Jackson Creek track, which we would return along in a couple day's time, also leaves from here.

The sun was shining as we made the approximately 3.5km walk to Chapter Lake from the registration book. The walk took us around 1.5hr and provided a 400m elevation gain.

Chapter lake was a spectacular first spot to visit, and it was here that we were pleasently surprised to find patches of orange fagus along the banks that had not yet lost their leaves. Feeding into Chapter Lake is Grail falls, which itself is fed by Chalice lake further upstream. We reached the top of grail falls at midday just in time for lunch.

After lunch we continued on past Chalice Lake towards Tent Tarn. It was easy walking from here, following a fairly well cairned track until Tent Tarn at which point we turned south off the track to head towards the ridgeline leading up to Cathedral Mountain, as the path we had been following would lead to the Twin Spires. There is a cairned track leading up Cathedral Mountain which we found once we reached the ridge, but I'm not sure where this track begins.

It took another hour or two to ascend to cathedral mountain where we were rewarded with a magnificent view of the Pelion Ranges. Mount Ossa, Pelion East, pelion West, and countless other mountains spanning the 180 degree panorama in front of us. We arrived shortly after 4pm and found a nice spot to camp near a large tarn which served as our drinking water. With sunset another couple of hours away we had plenty of time to set up camp and enjoy the view as the sun set over Mt Ossa.

The cairned peak of Cathedral mountain was about 100m from our camp spot. From the top we could look directly down into the valley below through which the Mersey river runs. Looking closely we could also spot the Kia Ora hut and the overland track. It was my first view of Mt Ossa and the Pelions up close, and it was magical to see so many places I hope to visit in front of us. The mountains and lakes around the region we were in follow a clear theme, but perhaps Cathedral Mountain is the most appropriately named. From the top it feels as though you are sat at the entrance of a grand cathedral spanning to the horizon.

As the sun dropped so did the temperature. The cairned peak of Cathedral mountain is unsheltered and the wind picked up, adding chill to the cold air. We stayed up long enough to see the stars come out before rugging up and going to bed.

The next morning we set off at around 9:30, after a porridge breakfast and watching the sun rise over Moun Ragoona. Today we hoped to reach Lake Meston where we would stay for night two. The plan was to head South East off track along the Cathedral Mountain Massif towards Convent Hill, and re-join the Jackson Creek trail at Cloister Lagoon. The route was around 19km, and we had no idea how much bush-bashing might lie ahead of us.
