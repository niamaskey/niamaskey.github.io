Edgeworth-David Base was our home away from home for 5 weeks during the 24-25 Denman Terrestrial Campaign. Located in the North-West of the Bunger Hills, Edgeworth-David was opened in 1986 as a summer base. With mild weather during the summer, generally low winds thanks to the protective hills, and a local tarn suitable for drinking from, this little corner of the Bungers perfectly demonstrates why Bunger Hills is also known as the Bunger Oasis.
