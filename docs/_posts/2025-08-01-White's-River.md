Five months after leaving Antarctica, it was time for a reunion with the team from Bunger Hills. In true polar style, we decided the reunion should be a snow weekend in Kosciuzko. Five of us were able to make it: Raph, Steph (both marine biologists), Caleb (geologist), his partner madeiline, and myself. I was collected by Raph and Steph from Sydney airport, and we drove straight down to Jindabyne, arriving later that night.

I was to share a tent with Raph, and it was then I found out we would be carrying a tent with no floor. We were using the Mont Hypermid - an ultralight trekking pole pyramid tent - without the inner. The tent was surprisingly sturdy, and had enough of a microclimate to keep the frost at bay.

This was my first time in the Snowies, and I was excited to have the whole weekend in the mountains. We set of from Guthega power station around 11am the next morning and began the walk towards Horse camp hut.
