This website is intended to be a repository mainly for photos I have taken or adventures and hikes I have been on. It is very much a work in progress and contains broken pages and stock template content. This will slowly change as I work out how to actually use html and css.

The site uses the [Lagrange template](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange) for Jekyll, by Paul Le.
